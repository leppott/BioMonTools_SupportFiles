NonTarget,TRUE = not appropriate to include in the MPCA IBI or BCG calculations. NonTarget taxa are excluded from all metric calculations,
Rank,level of taxonomic resolution,Rank
FFG,"Functional Feeding Group (method of food acquisition and functional role in aquatic food webs). Multiple entries are allowed and should be separated with a comma, either with or without a space (for example, either 'CG,CF' or 'CG, CF' are ok). Entries: collector-gatherer (CG), collector-filterer (CF), predator (PR), scraper (SC), shredder (SH), macrophyte herbivore (MH), omnivore (OM), parasite (PA), piercer-herbivore (PH), xylophage (XY)",FeedingGroupsCode

Habit,"Habit (how a macroinvertebrate moves in the aquatic environment and where they find food). Multiple entries are allowed and should be separated with a comma, either with or without a space (for example, either 'BU,SP' or 'BU, SP' are ok). Entries: Burrowers (BU), Climbers (CB), Clingers (CN), Sprawlers (SP), and Swimmers (SW)",Habitat

TolVal,"Tolerance values based on analyses of MPCA data. Used in several metric calculations (Hilsenhoff Biotic Index, intolerant taxa and tolerant taxa metrics). Very Intolerant taxa have values less than or equal to 2. Very Tolerant taxa have values equal to or greater than 8. Calculated using the weighted average of a general disturbance measure where taxa relative abundance was the weighting factor. The general disturbance measure was the first principal component of a principal components analysis of six disturbance variables including Minnesota’s Human Disturbance Score (HDS), the Minnesota Stream Habitat Assessment score, total phosphorus, total suspended solids, NH4, and nitrate/nitrite",MNToleranceStm
TolVal2,Coldwater sensitivity values based on analyses of MPCA data. Calculated using the weighted average of stream temperatures where taxa relative abundance was the weighting factor,ColdwaterTV

BCG_Attr_GP,BCG taxa attribute assignment for Glide/Pool streams not in the bug 8 or bug 9 class. 1 = specialist or regionally endemic; 2 = highly sensitive; 3 = sensitive ubiquitous; 4 = moderately tolerant; 5 = tolerant; 6 = nonnative,BCG_Attr_GP
BCG_Attr_RR,BCG taxa attribute assignment for Riffle/Run streams not in the bug 8 or bug 9 class. 1 = specialist or regionally endemic; 2 = highly sensitive; 3 = sensitive ubiquitous; 4 = moderately tolerant; 5 = tolerant; 6 = nonnative,BCG_Attr_RR
BCG_Cool_8,BCG taxa attribute assignment for bug8 (cool transitional) streams. 1 = specialist or regionally endemic; 2 = highly sensitive; 3 = sensitive ubiquitous; 4 = moderately tolerant; 5 = tolerant; 6 = nonnative,BCG_Cool_8
BCG_Cold_9,BCG taxa attribute assignment for bug9 (s coldwater streams). 1 = specialist or regionally endemic; 2 = highly sensitive; 3 = sensitive ubiquitous; 4 = moderately tolerant; 5 = tolerant; 6 = nonnative,BCG_Cold_9
