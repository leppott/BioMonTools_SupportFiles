TaxaID,taxon name (after translation; see taxa translator table)
RANK,level of taxonomic resolution
NONTARGET,FALSE = target (ok to include in calculations). TRUE = nontarget (not appropriate to include in the NM sandy bottom BCG calculation).
BCG_ATTR,"Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) taxa attribute assignments for the NM sandy bottom BCG: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 2 = highly sensitive; 3 = sensitive ubiquitous; 4 = moderately tolerant; 5 = highly tolerant; 6 = nonnative"
FFG,"Functional Feeding Group used for the NM sandy bottom BCG metric calculations: Collector-Gatherer (CG), Collector-Filterer (CF), Piercer-Predator (PH;PR), Predator (PR), Scraper (SC), or Shredder (SH). Multiple entries are allowed and should be separated with a SEMICOLON rather than a comma or space."
FFGSource_BCG,Source of FFG assignment used for the NM sandy bottom BCG metric calculations
Habit,"Habit types used for the NM sandy bottom BCG metric calculations: Burrowers (BU), Climbers (CB), Clingers (CN), Skaters (SK), Sprawlers (SP), and Swimmers (SW). Multiple entries are allowed and should be separated with a SEMICOLON rather than a comma or space"
HabitSource_BCG,Source of habit assignment used for the NM sandy bottom BCG metric calculations
TolVal,Taxa with tolerance values ranging from 0 to 3 are considered ‘intolerant’ to anthropogenic disturbance and are included in the ‘intolerant’ metric calculations. Those with values ranging from 7 to 10 are included in the ‘tolerant’ metrics.
