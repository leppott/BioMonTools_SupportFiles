Taxon_orig,taxon name from the original source file
Rationale,reason for the change (blank if no change)
OTU_MetricCalc,"original taxon name translated to a regional ID that harmonizes differences (such as syntax, changes in nomenclature, misspellings, etc.). Used for the thermal preference metric calculations. DNI (do not include - e.g., terrestrial, marine)"
OTU_BCG_ORWA,"Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) for the ORWA statewide BCG calculation. Worms are collapsed to Oligochaeta. DNI (do not include - e.g., terrestrial, marine)"
OTU_BCG_ORWA_worms,"OTU for the ORWA statewide BCG calculation, with worms at finer level of resolution. DNI (do not include - e.g., terrestrial, marine)"
TSN,"Taxonomic Serial Number - a unique, persistent, non-intelligent identifier for a scientific name in the context of the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS)."
