Taxon_Group,"major taxonomic groups - Other Non-Insect, Oligochaeta, Terrestrial, Coleoptera, Diptera, Chironomidae, Ephemeroptera, Heteroptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Megaloptera, Neuroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Fish"
Taxon,"taxon name from the selected OTU (OTU_MetricCalc, OTU_BCG_ORWA, etc.)"
NonTarget,FALSE = target (ok to include in calculations). TRUE = nontarget (not appropriate to include in any of the calculations).
BCG_attr,"Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) taxa attribute assignments (1i, 1m, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). 1i = sensitive specialist or regionally endemic; 1m = moderately tolerant specialist or regionally endemic; 2 = highly sensitive; 3 = sensitive ubiquitous; 4 = moderately tolerant; 5 = highly tolerant; 6t = nonnative tolerant"
BCG_PredContScore,"predicted BCG taxa attribute assignment (continuous scale) based on statewide dataset (Mark Fernandez, Tt, unpublished 2024)"
BCG_attr2,"placeholder - BCG attribute IV sub-level: 4_better, 4_middle, 4_worse"
FFG,"Primary Functional Feeding Group: collector-gatherer (CG), collector-filterer (CF), predator (PR), scraper (SC), shredder (SH), macrophyte herbivore (MH), omnivore (OM), parasite (PA), piercer-herbivore (PH), xylophage (XY). Multiple entries are allowed and are separated with a comma"
Habit,"Habit: burrowers (BU), climbers (CB), clingers (CN), sprawlers (SP), swimmers (SW), skaters (SK). Multiple entries are allowed and are separated with a comma"
Life_Cycle,"Number of broods or generations of an organism in a year (also referred to as 'voltinism'): univoltine (UNI), semivoltine (SEMI), or multivoltine (MULTI)."
Habitat,"Exploratory attribute developed by Robert Wisseman; Generalist (GENE), Lotic (LOTI), Lentic (LENT), primarily terrestrial (TERR), Marine (MARI)"
Noteworthy,Exploratory attribute developed by Robert Wisseman; TRUE = any taxon that is rare or unusual in a mid-order stream benthic biomonitoring sample.
LONGLIVED,TRUE = long-lived taxa that require more than one year to complete their life cycles
Thermal_indicator,"[used for metric calculations] Thermal preference assignments for taxa that are NOT flagged for variability: cold stenotherm (stenoc), cold (cold), cool (cool), cowa (cool/warm), warm (warm), warm stenotherm (warm), eurythermal. Source: Hubler et al. 2024"
ThermalPref_ALL,Thermal preference assignments that include taxa flagged for variability. Source: Hubler et al. 2024
ThermTol_Less30,Less30 = occurred in the regional OR/WA tolerance dataset but results were not reported due to low sample size (occurred in fewer than 30 samples)
MWMT_WAopt,"Maximum Weekly Maximum Temperature (MWMT) weighted average optima (°C), based on relative abundance data. Source: Hubler et al. 2024. MWMT came from the NorWeST modeled stream temperature dataset (Isaak et al. 2017). WAopt is commonly used for estimating the central tendency of a taxon along an environmental gradient. "
MWMT_PCT90,"MWMT value that corresponds with the 90th percentile of taxon occurrence, based on presence data. Source: Hubler et al. 2024"
Therm_TopIndicator,Representative taxa in each thermal indicator group. Source: Hubler et al. 2024
ThermVar,"yes = genera, tribes, subfamilies and families have children in more than one thermal preference category. Source: Hubler et al. 2024"
