Taxon_Group,"major taxonomic groups - Other Non-Insect, Oligochaeta, Terrestrial, Coleoptera, Diptera, Chironomidae, Ephemeroptera, Heteroptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Megaloptera, Neuroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Fish"
Taxon_orig,taxon name from the original source file
NonTarget,TRUE = not appropriate to include in the MaritimeNW BCG or Oregon/Washington MTTI calculations. NonTarget taxa are excluded from all metric calculations
Rationale,reason for the change (blank if no change)
OTU_MetricCalc,"original taxon name translated to a regional ID that harmonizes differences (such as syntax, changes in nomenclature, misspellings, etc.). Used for the thermal preference metric calculations. DNI (do not include) = NonTarget."
OTU_MTTI,Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) for the MTTI calculation. DNI (do not include) = taxon is not included in the MTTI calculation
OTU_BCG_MariNW,OTU for the MaritimeNW BCG calculation; this is the same as OTU_MetricCalc except worms are collapsed to Oligochaeta and mites are collapsed to Trombidiformes. DNI (do not include) = NonTarget.
TSN,"Taxonomic Serial Number - a unique, persistent, non-intelligent identifier for a scientific name in the context of the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS)."
