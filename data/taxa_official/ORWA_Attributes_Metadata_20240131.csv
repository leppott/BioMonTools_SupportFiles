Taxon_AttributeTable,"taxon name from the selected OTU (OTU_MetricCalc, OTU_MTTI, OTU_BCG_MariNW)"
NonTarget,FALSE = target (ok to include in calculations). TRUE = nontarget (not appropriate to include in the MaritimeNW BCG or Oregon/Washington MTTI calculations).
BCG_attr,"Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) taxa attribute assignments (1i, 1m, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). 1i = sensitive specialist or regionally endemic; 1m = moderately tolerant specialist or regionally endemic; 2 = highly sensitive; 3 = sensitive ubiquitous; 4 = moderately tolerant; 5 = highly tolerant; 6 = nonnative"
FFG,"Primary Functional Feeding Group: collector-gatherer (CG), collector-filterer (CF), predator (PR), scraper (SC), shredder (SH), macrophyte herbivore (MH), omnivore (OM), parasite (PA), piercer-herbivore (PH), xylophage (XY)."
Life_Cycle,"Number of broods or generations of an organism in a year (also referred to as 'voltinism'): univoltine (UNI), semivoltine (SEMI), or multivoltine (MULTI)."
Habitat,"Exploratory attribute developed by Robert Wisseman; Generalist (GENE), Rheophilic (RHEO), Depositional (DEPO), Specialized (SPEC), Headwater (HEAD), Riverine (RIVE), Brackish (BRAC), UNK = unknown"
Noteworthy,Exploratory attribute developed by Robert Wisseman; TRUE = taxa that are indicators of exemplary biodiversity or habitat
LONGLIVED,"TRUE = long-lived taxa that require more than one year to complete their life cycles. Source: 2012 designations provided by Sean Sullivan, Rhithron"
Thermal_indicator,"[used for metric calculations] Thermal preference assignments for taxa that are NOT flagged for variability: cold stenotherm (stenoc), cold (cold), cool (cool), cowa (cool/warm), warm (warm), warm stenotherm (warm), eurythermal. Source: Hubler et al. (submitted to Ecological Indicators)"
ThermalPref_ALL,Thermal preference assignments that include taxa flagged for variability. Source: Hubler et al. (submitted to Ecological Indicators)
ThermTol_Less30,Less30 = occurred in the regional OR/WA tolerance dataset but results were not reported due to low sample size (occurred in fewer than 30 samples)
MWMT_WAopt,"Maximum Weekly Maximum Temperature (MWMT) weighted average optima (°C), based on relative abundance data. Source: Hubler et al. (submitted to Ecological Indicators). MWMT came from the NorWeST modeled stream temperature dataset (Isaak et al. 2017). WAopt is commonly used for estimating the central tendency of a taxon along an environmental gradient. "
MWMT_PCT90,"MWMT value that corresponds with the 90th percentile of taxon occurrence, based on presence data. Source: Hubler et al. (submitted to Ecological Indicators)."
Therm_TopIndicator,Representative taxa in each thermal indicator group. Source: Hubler et al. (submitted to Ecological Indicators).
ThermVar,"yes = genera, tribes, subfamilies and families have children in more than one thermal preference category. Source: Hubler et al. (submitted to Ecological Indicators)."
